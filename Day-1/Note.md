In Java, data types are of two types: **primitive** and **non-primitive**.

## Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types consist of **boolean** and **numeric** types.

- **Boolean**: Represented by `boolean`.
- **Numeric**: Divided into **character** and **integral** types.
  - **Character**: Represented by `char`.
  - **Integral**: Further divided into **integer** and **floating-point** types.
    - **Integer**: Includes `byte`, `int`, `long`, and `short`.
    - **Floating-point**: Includes `float` and `double`.

Primitive data types have fixed sizes.

## Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive data types include:
- `String`
- `Array`
- `Class`
- `Stack`
- `Structure`
- `Union`

Non-primitive data types do not have fixed sizes.

## Variable Definition
A **variable** is defined as a named location in memory used to store data that can change during program execution.
