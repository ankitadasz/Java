in java whenever you pass a number just fr an example you are taking decimal as input bt you want the answer in float it will show error
ex-area of circle   float area;
area=3.14*r*r;
here it will take 3.14 as double but area is in float so to convert double to float you have to write area=3.14f*r*r
