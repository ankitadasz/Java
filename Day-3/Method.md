Methods are mainly of two types: **inbuilt** and **user-defined**.

For example:
- When we are calculating the factorial, product, or sum, these are **user-defined** methods.
- But when we use the `math` module, we can easily find the square root by writing `sqrt`. This is an **inbuilt** method.

Similarly, when you write `sc.nextInt()`, we don't know exactly how it takes the input, but it does. So, it's an **inbuilt** method.
